          <p>Just like that a month has passed,</p>
          <p>You've been here like the golden hour,</p>
          <p>I promise you this love will always last,</p>
          <p>Cuz it's true even from afar,</p>
          <br>
          <p>I want you here for all my life,</p>
          <p>Now I know choosing you was definitely right,</p>
          <p>If not you then your memories would surely suffice,</p>
          <p>Because falling for you is like falling from the highest height,</p>
          <br>
          <p>Your voice so good,</p>
          <p>Its like a lovely chime,</p>
          <p>Your words so beautiful,</p>
          <p>They're like a poem's rhyme,</p>
          <br>
          <p>Those late night calls,</p>
          <p>And those early morning texts,</p>
          <p>Everything just makes me fall,</p>
          <p>Harder and harder in your pretext,</p>
          <br>
          <p>Your eyes like an exploding star,</p>
          <p>Your voice like the hymn of gods,</p>
          <p>Tuning with me like the strings of guitar,</p>
          <p>Falling in love with you against all odds,</p>
          <br>
          <p>I just wish to stay with you forever,</p>
          <p>Your presence like the river from heaven,</p>
          <p>Flowing through Eve's garden nourishing my love like the golden flower,</p>
          <p>Baby you and only you can be my eleven.</p>

          <p>It's been long now,</p>
          <p>Since I left all this behind,</p>
          <p>I only left in hopes,</p>
          <p>That I would somehow move on with time,</p>
          <br>
          <p>It was neither easy nor was it difficult,</p>
          <p>I was probably stuck somewhere in the middle,</p>
          <p>Darkness all around, no sign of light,</p>
          <p>I thought leaving the only ray was somehow right,</p>
          <br>
          <p>I was stupid if I think about it now,</p>
          <p>But I didn't write all those poems just so they could say wow,</p>
          <p>I wrote in hopes someone would realise,</p>
          <p>How it feels to see this world through my eyes,</p>
          <br>
          <p>I was sitting alone waiting, for a person so pure,</p>
          <p>When she came it felt like, for every problem she is the cure,</p>
          <p>She entered my life, like autumn after winter,</p>
          <p>To have her forever, I'm ready to be a sinner,</p>
          <br>
          <p>With every step she took, flowers bloomed,</p>
          <p>In the garden of my life, where everything..hate consumed,</p>
          <p>The longer she walked, the quicker I fell for her,</p>
          <p>This new feeling in my heart was here to stay, forever,</p>
          <br>
          <p>When she smiles, I fall deeper and,</p>
          <p>When she talks, I realise I want only her,</p>
          <p>For her I want to be better, for her I want to be the best,</p>
          <p>Tell me god, is this true love or just another test? </p>
          <br>
          <p>Her name is srishti, and she is my world,</p>
          <p>My home and only place of comfort,</p>
          <p>I'll love her forever, in every single life,</p>
          <p>I want her forever, everytime like a wife,</p>
          <br>
          <p>So tell me baby, would you love me the same? </p>
          <p>Like I do in every mortal plane? </p>
          <p>Will you say yes to me in every life? </p>
          <p>But first in this, will you be my wife?</p>

          <p>When I look at the stars,</p>
          <p>And my frown falls apart,</p>
          <p>Cuz it's only you who I think about now,</p>
          <p>Baby you shine like those blinking stars,</p>
          <p>And baby you led me out of this dark path,</p>
          <br>
          <p>You are the reason for my smile,</p>
          <p>I have a dream, it's to make you mine,</p>
          <p>Your eyes like the cosmic clouds,</p>
          <p>And your smile makes me jump and pounce,</p>
          <p>I can live for your love cuz it's all I want,</p>
          <p>I can let this world burn just for you my girl,</p>
